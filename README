 tinytyrant
============

Minimal tokyotyrant client for table databases, using luasocket 
and struct.

It's basically a fork of lua-tokyotyrant, that it is the complete 
tokyotyrant client. Please, see
[http://github.com/phoenixsol/lua-tokyotyrant/]

The main diference is that lua-tokyotyrant uses nixio lib for socket 
and bit operations.
